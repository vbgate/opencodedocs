# Appendix

This chapter provides technical reference materials for Plannotator, including API documentation, data model definitions, and license information. These sections are primarily intended for users who need to understand the system's internal mechanisms or perform secondary development.

## Chapter Contents

| Page | Description |
|--- | ---|
| | [API Reference](./api-reference/) | View all API endpoints provided by Plannotator and request/response formats |
| | [Data Models](./data-models/) | Learn about data models used in Plannotator, including Annotation, Block, CodeAnnotation, etc. |
| | [License](./license/) | Understand Plannotator's license (BSL-1.1) and usage restrictions |

## Recommended Learning Path

The appendix content is relatively independent. You can read sections selectively based on your needs:

1. **Want to understand API interfaces** → Read [API Reference](./api-reference/) directly
2. **Want to understand data structures** → Read [Data Models](./data-models/)
3. **Want to understand usage restrictions** → Read [License](./license/)

::: tip Tip
The appendix content is primarily for reference and doesn't need to be learned in order. We recommend consulting relevant sections when encountering specific problems.
