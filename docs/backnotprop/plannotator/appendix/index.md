# Appendix

This chapter provides technical reference materials for Plannotator, including API documentation, data model definitions, and license information. These contents are primarily for users who need to deeply understand the system's internal mechanisms or perform secondary development.

## Chapter Contents

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [API Reference](./api-reference/) | View all API endpoints provided by Plannotator and request/response formats |
| [Data Models](./data-models/) | Understand data models used by Plannotator, including Annotation, Block, CodeAnnotation, etc. |
| [License](./license/) | Understand Plannotator's license (BSL-1.1) and usage restrictions |

## Learning Path Suggestions

The appendix content is relatively independent, you can selectively read based on your needs:

1. **Want to understand API interfaces** → Read [API Reference](./api-reference/) directly
2. **Want to understand data structures** → Read [Data Models](./data-models/)
3. **Want to understand usage restrictions** → Read [License](./license/)

::: tip Tip
Appendix content is mainly for reference, you don't need to learn in order. It's recommended to check relevant sections when you encounter specific problems.
