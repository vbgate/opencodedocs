## What You Need to Know Now

Plannotator uses the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL)** as its open source license. This is a special license designed to protect commercial value while eventually making the project fully open source.

## Core Terms

### License Type

| Item | Content |
| ---- | ---- |
| **License Name** | Business Source License 1.1 (BSL) |
| **Copyright Holder** | backnotprop (2025) |
| **Licensed Project** | plannotator |
| **Change Date** | 2030-01-01 |
| **License After Change** | Apache License, Version 2.0 |

::: info What is BSL?
Business Source License is a special license developed by MariaDB. It restricts certain commercial uses in the short term, but promises to convert the software to a fully open source license (like Apache 2.0) after a specific date. This model allows open source projects to obtain sustainable revenue during commercialization while ensuring long-term openness to the community.
:::

### Allowed Usage

According to BSL 1.1 terms, you may:

- ✅ **Copy, modify, and create derivative works**
  - You can perform secondary development based on Plannotator
  - You can modify source code to fit your needs

- ✅ **Redistribute**
  - You can distribute original or modified versions
  - Must retain original license notices

- ✅ **Non-production use**
  - Internal development, testing, and evaluation
  - Personal learning and research

::: tip Broad Internal Use for Individuals and Companies
BSL's definition of "non-production use" is broad, covering various scenarios for individuals and companies internally. You and your team members (including independent contractors) can freely use Plannotator for development, testing, and deployment.
:::

### Usage Restrictions (Important!)

**Core Restriction**: Plannotator may NOT be used for **Planning, Context, or Approval Services**.

#### What is "Planning, Context, or Approval Service"?

Any commercial product that allows **third parties** (other than employees and independent contractors) to access Plannotator functionality through direct or indirect operations belongs to restricted services. Specifically including but not limited to:

- **Cloud Service Providers**
  - SaaS platforms providing Plannotator functionality as part of their services
  - Hosting service providers providing Plannotator to customers or subscribers

- **Infrastructure Services**
  - Data center service providers
  - Cloud computing platform providers

- **Third Parties Offering Similar Services**
  - Any services provided by the above entities and their affiliates

::: warning Commercial Use Warning
If you plan to use Plannotator as part of a commercial service provided to third parties, you must obtain a commercial license in advance. Violating this clause will automatically terminate your rights to use current and all future versions of Plannotator.

## License Change Timeline

| Time Node | License Type | Description |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Current - 2030-01-01** | BSL 1.1 | Restricted open source license |
| **From 2030-01-01** | Apache 2.0 | Fully open source, no commercial restrictions |

### What Happens After the Change?

Starting January 1, 2030, Plannotator will automatically convert to **Apache License 2.0**. This means:

- ✅ All commercial restrictions will be removed
- ✅ Can be freely used for any commercial purpose
- ✅ Can be integrated into any SaaS service
- ✅ Complies with permissive open source license standards

## Commercial License

If you need to use Plannotator without complying with BSL restrictions (e.g., for planning, context, or approval services), you can:

1. **Purchase Commercial License**
   - Purchase from backnotprop or its authorized resellers
   - Obtain usage rights not subject to BSL restrictions

2. **Contact Licensor**
   - Email: backnotprop
   - Explain your use case and requirements

## FAQ

### Can I use Plannotator within my company?

**Yes.** BSL explicitly allows you and your employees, independent contractors to use Plannotator for internal development, testing, and deployment. Restrictions only apply to scenarios where you provide services to **third parties** (non-employees and contractors).

### Can I develop my own product based on Plannotator?

**Yes, with conditions.** If your product is:
- Internal tool: ✅ Allowed
- Personal project: ✅ Allowed
- Open source project: ✅ Allowed (retain BSL license)
- Commercial product: ❓ Need to assess whether it falls under "Planning, Context, or Approval Service"

### My company is a SaaS provider, can we use it?

**Commercial license required.** If your SaaS product provides Plannotator functionality to customers (even as a feature), this belongs to restricted commercial service and you must purchase a commercial license.

### Can I use Plannotator for any purpose after 2030?

**Yes.** From the change date onwards, Plannotator will use Apache 2.0 license, all commercial restrictions will be removed, and you can freely use it for any purpose.
