# About OpenCodeDocs

> **#1 AI Ecosystem Tutorial Site · Source-Driven · 100% Runnable**

## Our Vision

AI tools are iterating rapidly, official documentation lags behind, and online tutorials are outdated—we are here to change that.

OpenCodeDocs deeply analyzes open-source project source code and official examples to extract core logic, ensuring every line of code runs through automated verification.

When a project updates, our tutorials update synchronously. Each tutorial is clearly marked with the Git Commit version, so you know exactly which version the code is based on.

**Our goal is to become the "Verified Standard" in the AI tool community.**

## Open Source License

We believe openness brings trust. Contributions, corrections, and additions from the community are welcome.
