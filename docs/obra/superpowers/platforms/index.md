# Platform Integration

This chapter helps you understand the installation and configuration methods for Superpowers on three major AI coding platforms, including integration details for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex.

::: info Before You Start
This chapter assumes you have completed [Superpowers Installation](../../start/installation/). If you haven't installed it yet, please proceed to the installation chapter first.
:::

## Learning Path

It's recommended to follow the sequence below to learn about each platform, starting with the one you're currently using:

### 1. [Claude Code Platform](./claude-code/)
An official plugin designed specifically for Claude Code, featuring a hook system and seamless integration.
- Plugin installation method
- Automatic skill loading mechanism
- Session hook configuration
- Slash command usage

### 2. [OpenCode Platform](./opencode/)
A plugin-based integration solution supporting skill discovery and hot reloading.
- Plugin installation steps
- Skills directory configuration
- Automatic skill discovery
- Development mode vs production mode

### 3. [Codex Platform](./codex/)
An integration implemented through CLI tools, suitable for developers who prefer command-line interfaces.
- CLI tool installation
- Skill loading commands
- Skill management operations
- Configuration file instructions

### 4. [Platform Comparison and Selection](./platform-comparison/)
Compares feature differences and use cases across the three platforms to help you choose the most suitable one.
- Feature comparison table
- Use case analysis
- Performance comparison
- Migration guide

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Superpowers Installation](../../start/installation/)
- Understand basic concepts of [how to use skills](../../start/using-skills/)
- Familiar with basic operations of at least one AI coding platform

## Next Steps

After mastering platform integration, it's recommended to learn the [Core Workflows](../../core-workflows/) chapter to understand how to apply various Superpowers skills in real-world development.
