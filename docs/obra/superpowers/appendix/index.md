# Appendix: Skills Reference, Commands, and Architecture

The appendix provides technical reference documentation for Superpowers, including quick reference for all skills, complete command explanations, detailed agent definitions, and architecture design principles.

## Chapter Overview

This section contains the following technical reference materials:

- **Complete Skills Reference**: Trigger conditions, usage methods, and core points for all 14 skills
- **Command Reference**: Detailed explanations of slash commands (`/brainstorm`, `/write-plan`, `/execute-plan`)
- **Agent Reference**: Definitions and responsibilities for agents like code review agents
- **Architecture and Implementation Principles**: Deep dive into Superpowers' architecture design, hook system, and skill discovery mechanism

## Learning Path Recommendations

### Beginner Path

If you're just getting started with Superpowers, we recommend reading in this order:

1. First complete the [Quick Start](../../start/quick-start/) and [Core Workflows](../../core-workflows/) chapters
2. As you use Superpowers, return to this appendix when you need to quickly look up skills or commands
3. Read [Architecture and Implementation Principles](../architecture/) when you want to deeply understand how Superpowers works

### Advanced Path

If you're already familiar with the basic usage of Superpowers, you can:

1. Read [Complete Skills Reference](../skills-reference/) directly to comprehensively understand all skills
2. Refer to [Architecture and Implementation Principles](../architecture/) to prepare for writing custom skills
3. Check [Command Reference](../commands-reference/) to optimize your workflow command usage

## Prerequisites

Before reading this appendix, we recommend that you have completed:

- [Quick Start](../../start/quick-start/)
- At least one core workflow learning (such as [Design Workflow](../../core-workflows/design-workflow/))

## Next Steps

After completing this appendix, you can:

- [Write Custom Skills](../../extending/writing-skills/) to extend Superpowers functionality
- [Contributing Guide](../../extending/contributing/) to contribute your skills to the Superpowers project
- Return to [Core Workflows](../../core-workflows/) or [Advanced Features](../../advanced/) chapters for further practice
