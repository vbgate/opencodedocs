# Advanced Workflows

This chapter explains Superpowers' advanced workflows and techniques to help you achieve more efficient and professional development processes. Core content covers subagent-driven development, code review workflows, environment isolation, parallel scheduling, and comprehensive development workflow best practices.

## Sub-Page Navigation

### [Subagent-Driven Development](../subagent-development/): Rapid Iteration for Multiple Tasks
Leverage subagents to enable rapid iterative development across multiple independent tasks, executing two-stage automated reviews (spec compliance + code quality), avoiding context pollution, automating TDD workflows, and code review checkpoints.

### [Code Review Workflow](../code-review-workflow/): Establish Review Habits
Establish early, frequent code review habits, actively requesting code reviews at each development stage. Learn how to properly handle review feedback, prioritize feedback, conduct technical validation, and maintain code quality baselines.

### [Git Worktree Isolation](../git-worktrees/): Isolated Development Environment
Use Git worktrees to create isolated development environments while keeping the main branch clean. Learn directory selection priorities, security verification workflows, project setup, and test baseline validation, achieving concurrently safe development processes.

### [Parallel Agent Dispatch](../parallel-agents/): 3x Speed Bug Fixes
When facing multiple independent challenges, concurrently dispatch multiple subagents to achieve 3x efficiency gains. Learn independent domain identification, focused task creation, parallel dispatch, and review integration, applicable to scenarios like multiple test failures and multi-subsystem issues.

### [Branch Completion Workflow](../branch-completion/): Graceful Development Conclusion
Systematically handle development branch completion, including test validation, branch merging, PR creation, and Git worktree cleanup. Learn how to gracefully conclude development and avoid residual issues.

### [Complete Development Workflow Practice](../complete-workflow/): From Design to Deployment
Integrate all Superpowers skills, demonstrating a comprehensive seven-step development workflow from requirements analysis to feature deployment. Through practical scenarios, learn how to apply core skills like brainstorming, TDD, and code reviews in real projects.

## Learning Path Recommendations

We recommend studying the chapter content in the following order:

1. **Subagent-Driven Development** (Essential)
   - This is the core skill of advanced workflows
   - Multiple subsequent courses depend on this

2. **Code Review Workflow** (Recommended)
   - Establish good review habits
   - Use together with subagent-driven development

3. **Git Worktree Isolation** (Highly Recommended)
   - Create safe development environments
   - Avoid main branch pollution

4. **Parallel Agent Dispatch** (Optional)
   - Boost efficiency in specific scenarios
   - Requires familiarity with subagent-driven development

5. **Branch Completion Workflow** (Recommended)
   - Standardize development conclusion workflows
   - Use together with other advanced skills

6. **Complete Development Workflow Practice** (Comprehensive Practice)
   - Synthesize all skills
   - Recommended as the final learning step

::: tip Learning Tips
- **Progressive Learning**: We recommend studying in course order, each skill builds on previous knowledge
- **Practice-Focused**: Advanced workflows require extensive practice, don't just read without doing
- **Context-Aware**: Choose the skills most relevant to your actual project needs for deeper learning
::

## Prerequisites

To learn this chapter, you should have completed the following foundational content:

- ✅ **Core Workflows** ([core-workflows](../../core-workflows/)):
  - [Design Workflow: Brainstorming](../../core-workflows/design-workflow/)
  - [Planning Workflow: Writing Plans](../../core-workflows/planning-workflow/)
  - [Test-Driven Development: TDD Rules](../../core-workflows/tdd-workflow/)
  - [Debugging Workflow: Systematic Debugging](../../core-workflows/debugging-workflow/)
  - [Verification Workflow: Evidence First](../../core-workflows/verification-workflow/)

::: warning Why Are Prerequisites Required?
Advanced workflows build upon core workflows. Without the foundation, advanced techniques may not be correctly applied or could lead to issues. We recommend completing core workflow learning first.
