# Changelog

This chapter records Antigravity Tools' version evolution and release notes. Reading the Changelog before upgrading reduces the chance of encountering compatibility changes or regression issues.

## In This Chapter

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Release Notes](./release-notes/) | How to read the Changelog embedded in README, quickly assess upgrade impact, and complete post-upgrade verification |

## Learning Path

1. **Before upgrading**: First confirm your current version in Settings → About, then read only the version sections you're crossing over in the README's Changelog
2. **After upgrading**: Run `/healthz` for minimal verification to confirm the proxy still works normally

## Next Steps

- If you haven't installed or want to understand installation methods, first see [Installation & Upgrades](../start/installation/)
- If you want to understand basic proxy usage, see [Start Local Reverse Proxy & Connect First Client](../start/proxy-and-first-client/)
