## Learning Path Recommendations

The documentation in this chapter serves as **reference material** and doesn't need to be read in order. We recommend referring to relevant sections as needed while studying the main tutorial:

- When learning [Installation and Configuration](../../start/installation/), refer to [CLI Commands Reference](../cli-commands/)
- When learning [Initialize Factory Project](../../start/init-project/), refer to [Directory Structure Explained](../directory-structure/)
- When learning various pipeline stages, refer to [Tech Stack Explained](../tech-stack/)
- When you need to understand quality standards for generated code, refer to [Code Standards](../code-standards/)

## Prerequisites

No prerequisites required. However, to better understand the content in this chapter, we recommend completing the following tutorials first:

- ✅ [Quick Start: From Idea to App](../../start/getting-started/)
